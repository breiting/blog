Software development is my passion. I bought my first PC equipped with a
[80286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286) in the late eighties working with
[MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS). In 1995 is started my computer science studies at
JKU Linz, Austria, and
graduated as Dr. techn. at Graz University of Technology in the year 2005.

After founding [reecon](https://www.reecon.at) - a software consulting company - in 2013, I started my
next venture with [Robotic Eyes](https://www.robotic-eyes.com) where I am currently acting as technical director.

I am a [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) geek, and currently running [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/).
I am a passionate [neovim](https://neovim.io) user and living mainly in the CLI world.

This site is a collection of interesting stuff I am working on, or things which are keeping me busy.
Please feel free to visit my work on [GitHub](https:/github.com/breiting) or things we are working
on at [Robotic Eyes](https://github.com/roboticeyes).
