My name is **Bernhard Reitinger** and software development is my passion. I bought my first PC
equipped with a [80286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286) in the late eigthies working with
[MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS). In 1995 is started my computer science studies at
JKU Linz, Austria, and graduated as Dr. techn. at Graz University of Technology in the year 2005.

After founding [reecon](https://www.reecon.at) - a software consulting company - in 2013, I started my
next venture with [Robotic Eyes](https://www.robotic-eyes.com) where I am acting as CTO.

on my Macbook Pro. I am a pationate [vim](https://www.vim.org/) user and living mainly in the CLI
world.
