I recently discovered the "new" programming language [Go](https://golang.org) and really got my attention. Go was
announced in November 2009 and the first version (v1.0) was released in March 2012. Go has strong influence from the C
programming language but brings some cool features:

* Statically typed and scalable to large systems (like Java or C++)
* Productive and readable, without excessive boilerplate
* Not requiring integrated development environments (nice VIM integration :-)
* Supporting networking and multiprocessing

Mandatory for every programming language, there is my first Go program (`main.go`):

{{< highlight go >}}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hi Gopher!")
}
{{</ highlight >}}

You can easily run your first Go program from your terminal:

```sh
$ go run main.go
```

Start now and download Go on your [machine](https://golang.org/dl/).
