A couple of years ago, I invested into a solar energy system, which is mounted
on my roof and can produce 4kw peak. As of writing this article I already
produced 35 mega watt energy for my house.

The inverter is a Fronius Symo 3.7 and has LAN as well as WIFI in order to show
the current produced energy. The WIFI can be configured by directly connecting a
PC with a LAN cable.

Every once in a while, I am re-configuring my WIFI system and had to change the
SSID as well as the passwords. Everytime I do also have to connect via LAN and
re-configure the WIFI settings on the inverter.

The following steps are necessary to properly connect to the inverter with a
laptop and a connected LAN cable:

1. Connect a laptop with a LAN cable to the RJ45 connector.
1. Setup the network address to static address (see the settings below)
1. Open up a browser and go to `169.254.0.180`, which is the pre-defined address
   for the Fronius Symo inverter.
1. Use the web gui to change your WLAN settings.

```
mode       : manual
ip address : 169.254.0.10
subnet     : 255.255.255.0
router     : 169.254.0.180
```

Everytime, I again had to do the research, so I hope this simple tutorial helps.
