I am currently waiting for my new machine, which I ordered 2 weeks ago. After a lot of research and
evaluation, I finally decided to pick the [Lenovo
T490s](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-t-series/ThinkPad-T490s/p/22TP2TT490S).
I actually wanted the X1 Carbon, but I was unable to order this machine here in Austria (for
whatever reason).

Nevertheless, the T490s is pretty close to the X1, and delivers a decent platform for my new Archlinux
installation. While I am waiting for the delivery (expected date end of next week), I am mentally
prepare myself with a new and fresh Arch installation.

In order to see, which packages will reside on my new machine, I just checked the list of installed
packages on my existing Arch installation. And I was surprised! I have **1376!** packages installed
over the last 2 years.

```sh
$ pacman -Q | sort > packages.txt
```

This is not inline with my definition of minimalism. I just decided to install the bare minimum
system and then add the things which pop-up along the way.

A great article about setting up a base Arch Linux system using encrypted disks can be found
[here](https://linuxconfig.org/install-arch-linux-on-thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-7-with-encrypted-filesystem-and-uefi).

Of course, [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) is my preferred (tiled) window manager. With [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/)
and [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) I am fine to start. Just have a look
at my [list of software packages](/posts/2019-03-12-suckless) I use.
