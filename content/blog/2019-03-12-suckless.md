In the last years, I tried get more efficient by removing bloated software on my machine. Some of you may know that I am
running [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), which builds the basis for my daily activities. On top of it, the
[terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rxvt) is my main working area. Last year I switched from traditional window
managers to the tiling window manager [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org). Tiling window managers have the advantage that
your screen is not messed up with floating windows which need to be moved, resized using the mouse. This is how my
environment looks like as of writing this blog:

I tried to build a table of preferred software programs which serve a certain purpose. I addition to the programs, I
also have a set of config files ([dotfiles](https://github.com/breiting/breiting)) configuring my working environment.
